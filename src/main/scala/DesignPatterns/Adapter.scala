//the pattern Adapter is used to change the interface of some Adaptee
object AdapterPattern extends App {

  //the client makes calls to methods NewMethod1 and NewMethod2 that take no parameters
  //however, the class Adaptee does not provide these methods and other clients keep
  //invoking the method SomeCoreMethod
  class Adaptee {
    def SomeCoreMethod(msg: String): Unit = println(msg)
  }

  //this is one way to present an adapter as a trait that obtains access
  //to the method SomeCoreMethod
  trait Adapter {
    this: Adaptee =>
    def NewMethod1 = SomeCoreMethod(this.getClass.getName)

    def NewMethod2 = SomeCoreMethod(this.getClass.getPackageName)
  }

  //then we mix the trait with the adaptee and voila! - everything is ready
  val objectWithAdaptee = new Adaptee with Adapter
  objectWithAdaptee.NewMethod1
  //but the original method is still available
  objectWithAdaptee.SomeCoreMethod("bummer!")

  //the other way to use an adapter is to use it as a new interface
  trait AdapterAbstract {
    def NewMethod1: Unit

    def NewMethod2: Unit
  }

  //whereby a class implements this new interface and uses the class Adaptee internally
  //to enable the functionality of the new interface
  class Adapted extends AdapterAbstract {
    private val adapteeObject = new Adaptee

    override def NewMethod1: Unit = adapteeObject.SomeCoreMethod(this.getClass.getName)

    override def NewMethod2: Unit = adapteeObject.SomeCoreMethod(this.getClass.getPackageName)
  }

  //finally, the adapter conversion can be done implicitly
  implicit class AutomaticAdapter(adaptee: Adaptee) {
